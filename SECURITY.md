## Supported Software

Repositories owned by this organization are **not** supported.
This especially includes [forks](#forks) and [demos](#demo-repositories).

## Unsupported Repositories

### Forks

:information_source: If a repository is a [:fork_and_knife:fork](https://github.com/orgs/check-spelling-sandbox/repositories?type=fork), it is probably not supported and shouldn't be used for production systems.

:fork_and_knife:Forks are generally used to test [check-spelling/check-spelling](https://github.com/check-spelling/check-spelling) and [check-spelling/spell-check-this](https://github.com/check-spelling/spell-check-this/).

### Demo repositories

This includes:
* [example](https://github.com/orgs/check-spelling/repositories-sandbox?q=example&type=source) repositories
* [test](https://github.com/orgs/check-spelling/repositories-sandbox?q=test&type=source) repositories
* repositories named for other vendors (typically to demonstrate/test check-spelling against their software)

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

If you find a vulnerability in a repository here, you probably should check on an upstream repository and report it to the upstream vendor.
